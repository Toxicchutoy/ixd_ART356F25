Ch 4 Doet part 2 

In the second part of Chapter 4, Norman focuses on how constraints, mappings, and feedback guide users toward intuitive interactions. I was especially struck by the idea that constraints-physical, cultural, semantic, and logical-don't just limit action but also help users understand what actions are possible and appropriate. As Norman writes, "Semantic constraints rely upon the meaning of the situation to control the possible actions" (p. 155), which helped me see how even simple visual cues can reduce confusion. His point on mapping also stood out: when controls reflect real-world logic, users don't need instructions. And feedback, like a color change or animation, is essential to let users know their action worked. Norman's emphasis on clear, immediate responses made me rethink how I design interactions in my own web projects. Instead of adding more buttons or labels, I should focus on making cues more visible and meaningful, so users don't have to guess what to do next.
