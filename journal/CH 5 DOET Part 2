In the second part of Chapter 5, Norman explains that mistakes rarely come from a single bad action; they come from a chain of small problems in the design of systems. He shows how complex technologies, especially those with automation, can confuse users by hiding information or making it unclear what the system is supposed to do. When things go wrong, people are often blamed, but Norman argues the real cause is usually poor design that doesn’t support users during unexpected situations. Good design, he says, should assume people will be distracted or interrupted, and therefore must make system behavior obvious, prevent harmful actions, and provide strong feedback and recovery options. Ultimately, he calls for designs that are resilient, forgiving, and built around how humans actually think and act, not how we wish they behaved.
