CH 5 DOET Part 1

Chapter 5 starts with the concept of "human error," arguing that difficulties encountered by users are typically attributable to bad design (162), suggesting that what is often termed "human error" should be correctly identified as "system error" (162). This perspective posits that design must accommodate the inherent human tendency to make mistakes, accepting that error is intrinsic to our nature (163). To diagnose the true cause of failure, the material advocates for detailed root cause analysis, specifically championing the "Five Whys" technique, which demands repeated interrogation of an event to uncover deeper, underlying causes rather than stopping at the initial finding of a human mistake (165, 169). The chapter systematically categorizes human failures into two primary classes: slips (170) and mistakes (170). Slips happen when a person's intentions are correct, but the execution is flawed, often resulting  in issues like capture slips or mode errors (174, 177–179). Mistakes come from  faulty conscious deliberation leading to the formulation of an incorrect goal or plan, such as rule-based mistakes or knowledge-based mistakes (179, 184). Finally, the analysis acknowledges that complex failures are rarely caused by a single factor, often involving a combination of issues, including logical errors, social pressures, and organizational hierarchy, which can be obscured post-accident by the cognitive trap of hindsight bias (186, 190).
