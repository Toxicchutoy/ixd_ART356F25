CH 1 DOET



In the first chapter of the design of everyday things by Don Norman he talks about how there people make things in order to make it easier to understand a product but sometimes it confuses users if it is not clear enough. An example of this is  on pages 14 and 15. On these pages he shows pictures of the instructions from the inside of his refrigerator that is showing how to change the temperature. There are a bunch of words, numbers, and symbols that are trying to tell you how to change it. At first glance it is really confusing and hard to understand. A user can take the time to read and understand this but it will take time. As a designer you need to make sure that when you make instructions like that that other people will be able to follow along with it and not just you. He also talked about affordances and signifiers. An affordance suggest how something might be used and a signifier lets you know that this is the way hat something is to be used. On pg.10 they give an example of how an affordance works. They give the example of how you can know how to push or pull a door without any signs based on the type of handle it has.
